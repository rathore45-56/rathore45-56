## Hi there 👋
## 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms Progress

I am actively enhancing my problem-solving skills by practicing Data Structures & Algorithms with consistent daily learning and coding. I have completed core foundational concepts including:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Recursion
- Sorting & Searching

I have solved multiple problems related to these topics while focusing on optimal solutions and clean code structure.  
Currently, I am working on advanced topics, and my upcoming roadmap includes:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Trees & Binary Search Trees
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)
- Dynamic Programming (DP)

📍 My goal is to master data structures required for real-world technical interviews and maintain daily GitHub commits by solving topic-wise problems.
